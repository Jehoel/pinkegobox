Both users have a GTC/BLP (whatever) which allows anyone to view their status if they aren't explicitly blocked

TestUser  = Alice
BillGates = Bob

Alice adds Bob to her ForwardList
So the server notifies Bob (since Alice is now on his RL)
Alice also immediately adds Bob to her AllowList (as you do when adding people as a contact)

----------------

Bob receives a notification that Alice added her, he clicks Allow+Add then OK
Alice receives a notification that Bob is now on her RL

// for some reason, Bob sends two ADD AL testuser@hotmail.com requests
//	with the exception of the trid, it's identical; even the customName (which is set to FriendlyName)

ignoring the duplicate ADD AL testuser@hotmail.com that Bob sends, Alice receives NLN that Bob is online
	but Bob does not receive an NLN for Alice
...until Alice changes her status

BTW, NLN does not seem to be the right way to notify a rename
According to NotificationServer.java, line 861 it is REA, I guess I was using the wrong syntax
