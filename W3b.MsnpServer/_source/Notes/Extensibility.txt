As the form of the MSNP server hasn't changed over the years, I could implement different protocol version handlers like so:

class Msnp2Handler {

protected virtual void HandleBlp() {

}

protected virtual void HandleSomeVolatileVerb() {
}

}

class Msnp3Handler : Msnp2Handler {

protected override void HandleSomeVolatileVerb() {

}

}

...because inheritance is additive. Each handler would be responsible for calling each method though, so they'd all have their own giant switch blocks
	but that shouldn't be a problem
	it also solves the problem of obsolete methods being called

meanwhile, the "infrastructure" would continue to be handled by my static *Services classes

good job, methinks :)
