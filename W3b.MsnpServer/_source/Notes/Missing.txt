Bugs and things not yet implemented in my implementation:
============================================================

* FND Verb
* SND Verb
	* I have documentation now
* User status on add
	* When adding a person (and that person adds them to their AL)
* Note how all the UserProperties lists have a userHandle tied to a 'last seen' customName attribute
	* Apparently I think I'm doing it wrong (again) and that there is *one* customName for a user on another user's userlists rather than one customName per list
		* I don't think this requires changing anything though, it might be useful for later protocols. Just be sure to update all lists when the client says
* MSG Bug
	* Messages are sent to the sender as well, broadcast isn't implemented right

CANTFIX:
============================================================

* Implementing MD5 Challenge without needing the plaintext password on the server
	* I believe this is possible as it's part of HTTP
	* I can think of how to implement if if the challenge string is identical to the hash salt used in the database
		* But that makes it suspecible to replay attacks since the challenge remains the same
	* Turns out this is auth system is called "CRAM-MD5"
		* "Digest-MD5" is different
	* Just use machine-key encryption
