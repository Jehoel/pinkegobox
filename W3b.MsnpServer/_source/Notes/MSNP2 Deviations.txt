====== Draft Spec Violations

DS: XFR

	MSN Messenger Service 1.0 client requires additional parameter "0" at the end of an XFR

SB: USR
	The draft requires that the client return with the token of the session that was provisioned
	but the client doesn't
		I think this was because I wasn't including the 'CKI' bit in the XFR response

NS: XFR
	The response is only meant to give a hostname, the client is meant to connect on port 1863, there is no provision in the spec for port numbers.
	Yet when I specify a port it uses that. I'm not complaining, but it should be noted for anyone implementing an MSNP2 client against my sever.

====== Undocumented Commands:

NS: CVR trId <langId> <os> <osVersion> <processor> <clientName> <cliVersion>
	
	<langId> is in the form "0x0409" (for 1033)
	
	Sent immediately after the CHG, the CHG ends with a number equal to the length of this message, which makes me think it's a payload
	That number is a length indicator (because I got the same message but with a longer trId, so it matches)
	I'll just ignore it for now

DS: CVQ trId <langId> <os> <osVersion> <processor> <clientName> <cliVersion>
	
	Sent after a CVR0 response to VER, seemingly identical to CVR. MSNPWiki has further details. I should organise MSNPWiki further, methinks.

NS: FND trId fname=<firstName> lname=<lastName> city=* state=* country=*
	
	Sent after using the "Find user" feature. I don't know what kind of response is expected

NS: URL trId <service> <optionalParameter>
	
	<service> =
		COMPOSE, "Send Mail"
			COMPOSE can have an optional extra parameter: the email address to send the email to
		INBOX, "Inbox"
		
NS: SND	trId <targetUserEmail> 0x0809 MSMSGS
	
	Send when told to send an invite email to a just-added user to the list
		0x809 is 2057; is the LCID for the United Kingdom (or maybe Great Britain)
		This is probably documented on MSNPWiki. Btw note this was sent from Msgr2.0 in MSNP3 mode.

====== Undefined Server Responses

DS / NS: What error to send in case of bad password
There also other cases where I know I should send an error, but not sure which...

====== Odd Behaviour

DS: SYN trId <serial>
	
	For some reason both official and unofficial clients (Gaim 0.6) attempt to SYN with the dispatch server
		...contrary to the IETF draft spec
	This requires further investigation, I might be doing something wrong.

DS: SNP2 SVR0
	
	This mysterious command was sent whilst I was running into problems with my initial XFR implementation

Client:
	The 2.0 client periodically checks for a "links.txt" file in the same directory as the executable


========================
Changes seen in MSNP3 and later

How do I implement unread email notifications and new message notifications?
	That's in the NOT async command, I think?

MSNP4:
	URL trId MOBILE
		Set when changing pager address and clicking "Go to MSN Mobile..." button
	URL trId N2PACCOUNT 0x0409
		Set when clicking "Go to Net2Phone..." button to access the N2P Accounter Center
	URL trId PROFILE 0x0409
		Clicking "Edit Profile..."
	URL trId PERSON 0x0409
		Clicking "Member Services..."
	
	PRP trId <type> <number>
		<type>   = PHH | PHW | PHM
		<number> = URL-encoded phone number
