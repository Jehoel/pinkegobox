It's gonna be ok 
Can’t afford another day 
At 50 bytes per second

I’ve never seen your face 
I’ve never heard your voice

But I think I like it 
When you instant message me 
With a promise 
I can feel it 
I can tell you're gonna be 
Just like me

My eyes are gonna strain 
My heart is feeling pain 
At 50 beats per second

I’ve never seen your eyes 
I’ve never heard your lies

But I think I like it 
When you instant message me 
With a promise 
I can feel it 
I can tell you're gonna be 
Just like me
Be
Just like me

You turn
You turn 
You turn on me
